--WHAT IS IT?--
This module uses the Google Charts API to generate a QR code based on your
current URL.


--How do I use it?--
Install, and go to admin/config/system/googleqrcode to configure available settings.

Place block as desired, style as desired, set to show as you wish, and call
it a day! This is a fairly straight forward and simple module!

+-------------------+
Please note that this is a customised version of the google_qr_code module available from https://www.drupal.org/project/google_qr_code.

It adds an extra form field and alters the block display to include some extra text.
